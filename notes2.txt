Forcing Immediate Execution
    Queries that perform aggregation functions over a range of source elements must first iterate over those elements
    Examples of such queries are Count, Max, Average, and First
    These execute without an explicit foreach statement because the query itself must use foreach in order to return a result
    also that these types of queries return a single value, not an IEnumerable collection

    To force immediate execution of any query and cache its results, you can call the ToList or ToArray methods.

In a LINQ query, the from clause comes first in order to introduce the data source
